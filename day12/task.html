        <summary><h3>2.Malabar Prawn Curry:</h3></summary>
        <p>This prawn curry is spicy, sour, hot, sweet and tangy all at once. I use shallots for this dish as it is traditional and also they are milder. If you can get hold of shallots you 
        can opt for red onions too as they impart a lovely sweetness when fried</p>
